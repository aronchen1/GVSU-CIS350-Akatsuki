# Introduction

(In 2-4 paragraphs, describe your project concept)
For our project we will be planning, coding, and polishing a side-scroller game utilizing the Unity game engine. This will be a side scroller game based on the hit anime tv show "Naruto". In this game, the user will control a 2-D character who moves through levels in order to achieve a so far undecided goal. This game will operate on computers.

There will be computer generated enemies to increase level difficulty, along with obstacles to overcome and puzzles. For the enemies, we plan on using mutliple types of movment. Some will walk back and forth, while others move depending on the controlled player. The enemies will be able to attack in a slew of different ways, including by touch, weapons, and mind games. 

# Anticipated Technologies

* PC
* Unity game engine
* C# 
* Use Case Diagram web software

# Method/Approach

We will be using the "agile" method of approach to figure out the steps to creating this program. Before implementing any changes to software, our team will carefully plan and discuss any and all possible options. We will meet each week to talk about what is working, what needs to be done, and what we can improve upon. We will also take this time to assign tasks to be completed before future meeting times.
