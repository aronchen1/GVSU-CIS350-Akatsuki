# Team Name (Akatsuki)

Project description (~1 paragraph)

This will be a side scroller game based on the hit anime tv show "Naruto". In this game, the user will control a 2-D character who moves through levels in order to achieve a so far undecided goal. There will be computer generated enemies to increase level difficulty, along with obstacles to overcome. Maybe even some puzzles if we're feeling frisky. This game will be completed using the Unity web service, and will operate on computers.
